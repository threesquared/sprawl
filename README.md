> Generate pub crawl routes between Wetherspoons pubs

## About

Use this web app to generate a pub crawl route between Wetherspoons pubs in the UK.

N.B The "algorithms" used are pretty stupid so don't expect too much...

## TODO

* Think of a better start/end algorithm
* Introduce actual public transport travel times/routes
* Fetch data from the Wetherspoons api?
* Mobile app
* render graph on page load
