> Generate pub crawl routes

## About

Use this web app to generate a pub crawl route between pubs in the UK.

N.B The "algorithms" used are pretty stupid so don't expect too much...

## TODO

- Think of a better start/end algorithm
- Introduce actual public transport travel times/routes
- Mobile app
- render graph on page load
